Offline Capabilities
======================

Part of ICAS is to dynamically ingest records from infosec capabilities to
provide an analyst detailed insight into the network they are protecting.

These logs are results are only a beginning as to the potential tools will be

Volatility
----------

Volatility is an open source memory forensics capability [1].  While Volatility
is traditionally an offline capability, there are numerous published articles
discussing the use of Volatility in a "live" enviornment [2], [3].  In
addition, there are numerous commercial offerings, such as Carbon Black [4] and
Second Look [5], that are intending to provide much of the functionality of
Volatility in a live enviornment.
